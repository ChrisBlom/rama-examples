# rama-examples

This repository contains examples from the [Rama documentation](https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html).

Rama currently only works on macOS or Linux and doesn't work on Windows.

As explained in the docs, you can start a Groovy REPL with:

```
mvn compile
mvn gplus:shell
```

This is a great way to run the examples or experiment.

Please note: you should use Java 17 or below in order to avoid problems running the Groovy REPL.
